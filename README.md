### About Me 
Iâ€™m a **Soil Scientist** with a bachelor's degree in Chemistry and an MS in environmental engineering. </br> </br>
I review and test technology relating to soil and soil monitoring, or more broadly, environmental data acquisition and interpretation. I enjoy the data science aspect of soil and environmental science, particularly the movement of water through soil. I am very entrepreneurial and I look for opportunities for sales, market messaging and business development for the technology I'm working with. Finding pathways to bring technology to market is key to its success and helps develop the technology for the benefit of society.
 </br></br>
 
ðŸ’¬ Feel more than welcome to contact me if you need any help or want to discuss any soil or hydrological data! </br></br>
   
Soil is very complex and is critical for life on our planet. I truly believe that technology and data science will give us a better understanding of soil. A better understanding of soil can provide solutions to societyâ€™s most pressing problems such as climate change, food security, water resources, and flood forecasting.
